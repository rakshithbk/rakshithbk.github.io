The main components use are -</p><ul><li>WS2812B</li><li>ESP32</li><li>Power Supply</li></ul><p>The reason this is so simple is thanks to the individually addressable LEDs WS2812b. Without these, an Edge of the shelf or a segment in the 7-seg display of the digit had to be wired to the controller separately. And since most of the controllers will not have these many I/O pins, something like multiplexing or shift register should be used. This would have greatly increased the wiring and circuitry.</p><p>WS2812b is well tested and has good libraries written to abstract dealing with the data signals and controlling these ICs. In this project we will be using <a href="http://fastled.io/">FastLED</a>.</p><p>ESP32 is again my favorite low power low cost microcontroller with inbuilt WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. </p><p>Step 1 - Cutting the strip into smaller pieces<br>I could not stick the LEDs in single long strip as this would result in LEDs being present inbetween digit segments. So I measured the number of LEDs that would fit in each of the printed edge and cut the strip into pieces. 7 LEDs per segment in my case (with 60/m strip density).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200802_163115.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Digital Shelf Clock"><figcaption>Cutting strip for each Segment of the digit</figcaption></figure><p>Step 2 - Soldering the cut strips<br>The strips for each segment are soldered with small pieces of wire of length equal to the distance between two segments on the shelf.

I have borrowed his code and modified it to work with my wiring schematic and my OTA update library.</p><p>In a very brief explanation, this is what the program does.<br>The controller is connected to the internet (via wifi). Since there is no RTC or timekeeping systems on board, everytime the board is started, it will ping <a href="https://www.ntppool.org/en/">NTP </a> and fetch the correct time. Internal clocks on ESP can be used to update the time from this starting point, but periodically ESP will fetch time from the NTP servers to account for any drifts in the time (due to inaccuracies in internal clock).  Next is taking care of display and setting the LEDs according to the time.<br>Since the LEDs used are RGB, any color can be set to the digits. And the ESP works with blynk to provide this capability, so that the user can change colors and adjust brightness anytime from smartphone.<br>I plan on adding other functionalities like integrating google assistant to show time by asking country wise, add a snake game and more.</p><hr><h3 id="testing-connections-and-first-run">Testing connections and first run</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/led_first_test_optimized.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Digital Shelf Clock"></figure><p></p><h3 id="done">Done</h3><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="18050147" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.7785714285714287"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p style="text-align: center;">**** इति लेखः समाप्तम् ****</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snails in a Jar]]></title><description><![CDATA[From a Stick to Snails to Eggs to Baby Snail...]]></description><link>https://rbklabs.in/snails-in-a-jar/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f1db7b2bfea5f1170e6e1b5</guid><category><![CDATA[Nature]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rakshith BK]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 17:30:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/IMG_20200619_113857.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/IMG_20200619_113857.jpg" alt="Snails in a Jar"><p>It all started with a stick.

Generally the will be lot of work involved in order to deploy new application. Stop running processes, swap binaries, restart services in the required order and this is time consuming. The same applies even if its a on premise application, might be little simple, but still present. Create the right package - only the changes or the complete binaries, deploy on the CDS, notify user/application and handle the load.</p><p>So it is suitable to automate this process and in most of the time it remains constant through out the lifecycle of the application. CD can usually have different kinds of triggers, run a CD on commit, run a CD at specific time interval or have a manual trigger. </p><hr><h3 id="pipeline-in-hardware-projects">Pipeline in Hardware projects ?</h3><p></p><p>A CI/CD pipeline is almost always present in software based organizations. Without one its almost impossible to maintain quality and standard in the development and sanity of the master branch. All code goes through unit tests and the commits are run against automated test scripts or tested in sandbox envs.</p><p>But what about personal projects ? Especially Hardware projects ? when compared to software applications, in addition to all the steps involved, there is one more step of flashing to the board. So all the more reason to have a automated pipeline for this. </p><hr><h3 id="setup-your-own-pipeline-">Setup your own pipeline -</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543674892-7d64d45df18b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="CI / CD pipeline for ESP32"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@realaxer?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">tian kuan</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There are two parts to this process, the client side or ESP code for checking for updates, and the backend side for CI/CD pipeline.  </p><p><strong>ESP32 / hardware side -</strong></p><p>Lets look at the ESP side, the board can either poll the server time to time, or if there is a persistent connection, the server can inform when there is an update available. As an IoT endpoint, such devices will generally not have a public IP or if it is low power based, connection cannot be kept alive. </p><p>But if there is a requirement for the update to delivered as soon as its available, MQTT can be used for so that server can notify, and its designed for low power consumption.</p><p>In my case, the update cycle is more relaxed. ESP periodically checks with backend if there are any updates, so there will be couple of minutes of delay before the ESP checks and downloads the update. This depends on the checking interval defined.</p><p>Going into more specifics, the ESP will ask the backend for the latest version of the ESP firmware. After we get the response, the version is checked against its own firmware. If the version on backend is greater, then the new firmware is downloaded. There is a MD5 check for the binary downloaded to make sure that it is the right file (no man-in-middle attack 😅) and there are not corruptions at downloading.  After the check is passed the new update is applied.</p><p>Its good to note that even if faulty binary is flashed as part of the OTA, the ESP will never be rendered dead. On the soft reset after the update, if the ESP is not able to boot, it will roll back to the previous version. This is possible because the update will be flashed to new partition and moving back to old firmware is as simple as changing partition address in the lookup table. A great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" >video</a> on this if you are interested.</p><p>Right now the OTA library for ESP32 is in my  private repo, still needs some testing. I will add it here as soon as possible or checkout by GitHub repos.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/ota_esp_cropped.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="CI / CD pipeline for ESP32"><figcaption>Flow between ESP32 and the backend.

What I wanted was a analog control, something like potentiometer. This is achievable if the motion of the finger across the surface is somehow translated into change in capacitance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/download.gif" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller"><figcaption>Slider Control in Action.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="principle-of-operation">Principle of operation</h3><p>The capacitive slider surface can be of any shape and size you want. In this project I am simply using a strip of aluminium foil.</p><p>The main principle this works on is -</p><blockquote>Capacitance changes with increase/decrease in thickness of dielectric between the two electrodes.</blockquote><p>To leverage this I am creating a gradient of insulator on top of the aluminium foil to get this change in the capacitance from one end of the strip to another.</p><p>The choice of dielectric is clear plastic tape (sellotape), that is applied multiple layers. The tape is cut shorter by a few mm each time for the new layer applied on the aluminium foil. This will create a gradual increase in the thickness of the insulation over the strip. The change is still in terms of discreet steps, resolution of which should be decided based on the application and use case.</p><p>I could not take any good pictures to show the layering on my strip, so here's a 3D render of what it will look like -</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/mtal_strip.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller"><figcaption>Each translucent square is one sensitivity zone, so this strip has a resolution of 6.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/dielectric_gradient.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller"><figcaption>The layers of tape gets shorter as visible, to change the dielectric thickness</figcaption></figure><hr><h3 id="code">Code</h3><p>The logic is to read the touch inputs repeatedly and check if the value has increased or decrease as compared to the previous reading. Each time such increase or decrease happens ideally your finger has moved from a point on the strip of one thickness to another point of different thickness.</p><p><strong><strong>By having a count of such increase/decrease, we can get an analog value reading as well as direction of swipe.</strong></strong> And this can be achieved from one GPIO pin of ESP32.</p><p>Note: The code provided in this project is more of an proof of concept than a finished library. A lot has to be refined and polished before turning this into a general purpose library that can be used along with others in a typical project.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/f69d29d2b7344cf97f98c91c262c1e66.js"></script>

Or rather the lack of it. Every semester, even though the org knows exactly how many students will be looking forward for their results, it always fails to scale up their servers to cater to this load. It usually takes hours to get your results after they are released. The webpage does not load, the result request is not queried, or the whole website just crashes. And moreover the results of the previous semester will be wiped out before the new ones are uploaded. So there is no way for a student to get his last results (screenshot is the only option) or rather all his sem results in one place.</p><p>I wanted to create a website that would store these results, of all semesters and would display them on request. And this also falls under the web-scraping domain, which I wanted to do a project in. So I started to work on getting the details required, but the problem was the form to query the results also had a CAPTCHA.</p><p>So in this article i will be explaining the steps I took to decode them and convert to text so that I can get whats behind it.</p><hr><h3 id="the-captcha-image">The CAPTCHA image</h3><p>The image is not that complex when compared to other google captchas that has a lot of features like warping, tilt, blur, skew etc.. to consider in the text that has to be decoded.</p><p>Saying that, this took a bit of work as well, since I decided to solve this without additional libraries, just simple python. Using open source projects Tessaract or other OCRs will be a bit of overkill for this Image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/yourcaptcha.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"><figcaption>captcha image in the results page of the website.</figcaption></figure><p>I saved a few such Images and found that the text is always at the center and in green color. And the entire image is covered in static/noise. </p><p>Initially I thought of extracting Green from the RGB matrix of the image, since the text that i want is entirely in green. But this didn't work as there was a lot of noise pixels that were in green also.

Then i made a gcode for a 2mm thickness print and tried it out.</p><p>Things to keep in mind -</p><ul><li>Make sure the nozzle height is adjusted properly. If not this could drag the cloth with the nozzle moment, burning it or damaging the nozzle itself.</li><li>Keep the extruder temperature to a minimum. Make sure the temp is only what is required, this is because prints on white cloths left a dark shade at parts with thin print lines. That being said don't lower the temp so low that the extruder jams. Usually PLA has a range to temp that it can be used with, keep it at the lower end.</li><li>Have a good end script on your slicer. I have used a script that will lift the extruder 20mm and then home all axis. This will keep the rest of your t shirt that's dangling outside of the printbed safe.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---Copy.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="3D print - Experimental Stuff"><figcaption>This is 1 layer thick print.

I came across this wearable tech on one of the kickstarter campaigns. It was around 6000% funded. (yes six thousand). So it got me curious, either it was a very successful scam or a revolutionary technology.</p><p>I thought it could be scam because, ACs take up most of our power bill and yet here it is, a small portable battery operated solution that could save 1000s of our hard earned money and cut down on pollution at the same time. But if it was so good why didn’t anyone think of it before..? Why is it that all the big companies, constantly looking for innovation, never made any of these wearable ..?</p><p>So I wanted to make one myself and check it out. I purchased all the components required and started to build it. More over it does not require much hardware, essentially  a Peltier module and a microcontroller is all that is needed. even microcontroller is not required, once the correct rhythm is known a simple 555 timer can be used. I used Attiny85 so that other peripherals can be added in the future easily.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220424.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></figure><p>The way it works is pulsating heat/cold on the wrist, where the veins are more towards the surface and is temp sensitive. Instead of having a constant hotness or cooling, in which case our body will adjust to this temperature and the device will have no affect in sometime, the temperature change come in waves. This way our body will still retain sensitivity. </p><p>But i think even a periodic wave could be not much effective. Our body could detect regular intervals and could be conditioned to it. Having module turn on at random interval of time and for random period could give better results. This is something I should try.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220720-1.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220659-1.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220849.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div></div></div></figure><p>And I tried different heat/cooling pulse wave lengths. Even though it was oddly cool and comfortable,I did not find it much effective on hot afternoons. I tested this watch on my friends, and some liked it very much.

I wanted to keep this on my desk and the low sunlight had already killed my old plant, so i am not taking any chances. Cactus it is.</p><p>I also printed a small caution sign for my cactus. I wanted to put this on my office desk and you never know who will go 'nice plant' and grab it palms open. Just some legal cover will never hurt😊. This sign board is special too, its two color 3D print, and not painted. You can have a look at it here.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190115_094728.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="3D print - Self Watering Planter"><figcaption>My minimalist desktop setup</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

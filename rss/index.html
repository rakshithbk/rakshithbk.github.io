In the example I will be decoding the captch of VTU website, which is an University for Engineering courses and has captcha at results portal. <br>The approach detailed in this article is not a general purpose solution, but can be used for captchas of similar complexities.</blockquote><p> </p><h3 id="preface">Preface</h3><p>VTU results page is known for its speed, reliability, performance and user-friendly interface. Or rather the lack of it. Every semester, even though the org knows exactly how many students will be looking forward for their results, it always fails to scale up their servers to cater to this load. It usually takes hours to get your results after they are released. The webpage does not load, the result request is not queried, or the whole website just crashes. And moreover the results of the previous semester will be wiped out before the new ones are uploaded. So there is no way for a student to get his last results (screenshot is the only option) or rather all his sem results in one place.</p><p>I wanted to create a website that would store these results, of all semesters and would display them on request. And this also falls under the web-scraping domain, which I wanted to do a project in. So I started to work on getting the details required, but the problem was the form to query the results also had a CAPTCHA.</p><p>So in this article i will be explaining the steps I took to decode them and convert to text so that I can get whats behind it.</p><hr><h3 id="the-captcha-image">The CAPTCHA image</h3><p>The image is not that complex when compared to other google captchas that has a lot of features like warping, tilt, blur, skew etc.. to consider in the text that has to be decoded.</p><p>Saying that, this took a bit of work as well, since I decided to solve this without additional libraries, just simple python. Using open source projects Tessaract or other OCRs will be a bit of overkill for this Image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/yourcaptcha.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"><figcaption>captcha image in the results page of the website.</figcaption></figure><p>I saved a few such Images and found that the text is always at the center and in green color. And the entire image is covered in static/noise. </p><p>Initially I thought of extracting Green from the RGB matrix of the image, since the text that i want is entirely in green. But this didn't work as there was a lot of noise pixels that were in green also. What worked is a simple thresholding of the image.<br>Converted my image to monochrome/binary with appropriate threshold value to select between black pixel or white pixel worked far better than I had imagined.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/ff9eb3ab97f534be6acf5922de09323d.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Output of this thresholding captcha -</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/yourcaptcha-2.jpeg" width="176" height="35" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/captcha_Thresh-1.jpeg" width="176" height="35" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"></div></div></div></figure><p>Now that the text is clear, next is the OCR part of actually converting the contents on the image to usable text. Before that I had saved bunch of images and there was a pattern emerging, all the characters occupied same space at the middle of the image. And to visualize it better, I used this <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image">web-tool</a> to convert the pixels to text characters and saved it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/vtu_captcha_word_doc.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"><figcaption>Each character in that text is a pixel in binary.</figcaption></figure><p>Some points that came out about this captcha now-</p><ol><li>The text is always at the center and starts at <code>[60,11]</code> ie. top left corner and ends at <code>[113, 23]</code> ie. bottom right corner.</li><li>Each character in the text occupies exactly the same number of pixels ie- same height and width. Which means a rectangle mask can be used to extract each individual char. The dimensions of this mask <code>8 X 12</code>.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="manual-labeling">Manual Labeling </h3><p>Now that we know the dimensions and position of the charterers in the image and we have removed the noise, the next step is to isolate each character and start labeling. This is one step that is not automated, but is also one-time requirement.</p><p>Using a small script, I downloaded a bunch of captchas and chopped them down to individual characters and saved each one with different number as file name.<br>During the process I found out that characters -   <code>I L O i l o 1 0</code>  are not used. Which is actually quite obvious when you think about it, they are hard to distinguish from each other in several fonts.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/1a54149e185e9ef47d71950261859f26.js"></script>

This was one of the reason why I did not go the ML or tesseract way. Most of the processes there are gibberish to me and poking around the captcha showed that learning such libraries was way too much effort for solving this issue at hand. Anyway, It actually worked quite better than I had expected. I was just hoping for an accuracy of <code>0.6 - 0.7</code>, ended up getting close to <code>1</code>.</p><p>Thanks for sticking so long and I hope this article gave you a perspective on how to approach <em>solving an image-to-text problem.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3D print - Experimental Stuff]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some small projects like using 3D printer to print designs on t-shirts, print keys..]]></description><link>https://rbklabs.in/3d-print-experimental-stuff/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ec90b7c6e8de9119088ccb0</guid><category><![CDATA[3d]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rakshith BK]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 15:27:49 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---dark-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="1-t-shirt-printing"><br>1. T-shirt Printing</h3><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---dark-1.jpg" alt="3D print - Experimental Stuff"><p>3D printing is essentially chopping down objects into thin 2D surfaces and printing them on top of each other. So why don't we just stop the print after 2-3 layers to get a regular print on a surface ? And instead of on printbed, why not print on fabric ?</p><p>So I clamped an old t-shirt on to the print bed, removed the glass panel, and adjusted the end/stop switch for the z-axis to account for this change in height. Then i made a gcode for a 2mm thickness print and tried it out.</p><p>Things to keep in mind -</p><ul><li>Make sure the nozzle height is adjusted properly. If not this could drag the cloth with the nozzle moment, burning it or damaging the nozzle itself.</li><li>Keep the extruder temperature to a minimum. Make sure the temp is only what is required, this is because prints on white cloths left a dark shade at parts with thin print lines. That being said don't lower the temp so low that the extruder jams. Usually PLA has a range to temp that it can be used with, keep it at the lower end.</li><li>Have a good end script on your slicer. I have used a script that will lift the extruder 20mm and then home all axis. This will keep the rest of your t shirt that's dangling outside of the printbed safe.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---Copy.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="3D print - Experimental Stuff"><figcaption>This is 1 layer thick print.

I came across this wearable tech on one of the kickstarter campaigns. It was around 6000% funded. (yes six thousand). So it got me curious, either it was a very successful scam or a revolutionary technology.</p><p>I thought it could be scam because, ACs take up most of our power bill and yet here it is, a small portable battery operated solution that could save 1000s of our hard earned money and cut down on pollution at the same time. But if it was so good why didn’t anyone think of it before..? Why is it that all the big companies, constantly looking for innovation, never made any of these wearable ..?</p><p>So I wanted to make one myself and check it out. I purchased all the components required and started to build it. More over it does not require much hardware, essentially  a Peltier module and a microcontroller is all that is needed. even microcontroller is not required, once the correct rhythm is known a simple 555 timer can be used. I used Attiny85 so that other peripherals can be added in the future easily.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220424.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></figure><p>The way it works is pulsating heat/cold on the wrist, where the veins are more towards the surface and is temp sensitive. Instead of having a constant hotness or cooling, in which case our body will adjust to this temperature and the device will have no affect in sometime, the temperature change come in waves. This way our body will still retain sensitivity. </p><p>But i think even a periodic wave could be not much effective. Our body could detect regular intervals and could be conditioned to it. Having module turn on at random interval of time and for random period could give better results. This is something I should try.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220720-1.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220659-1.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20181001_220849.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" alt="Wearable / Wrist-watch AC"></div></div></div></figure><p>And I tried different heat/cooling pulse wave lengths.

One vote for one citizen.</p><p>Thus in this digital era it is only fair that the identity of the voter is biometrically verified before he impacts the future of the country. In this project we have designed a device that will first ask the user to scan his/her fingerprint in order to proceed with the voting. If the fingerprint is found in the records then the option to select the contesting party will be activated. Once the vote is registered by pressing the appropriate button which is next to the party name, it is saved and next person can cast the vote.</p><p>If the same person tries to vote multiple times, the device does not allow the same as the fingerprint would have been marked voted during the first vote. Since this is unique multiple votes can be prevented.</p><p></p><p>In practical implementations, fingerprints of all the citizens can be fetched from the  Aadhar details and a database can be formed against which the voter fingerprints can be verified.</p><p>This also means that the voter is not restricted to that specific booth and can vote from any voting station near him. This could also help in increasing voters percentage.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/VoterMachine-Insides.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Fingerprint based Voting Machine"><figcaption>What's cooking Inside</figcaption></figure><p>The project employs a simple algorithm and is just a proof of concept.</p><p>It has 20 stored fingerprints in its database and one master/admin fingerprint that will be used to display the total votes of all contesting parties in the end.

Took me 5-6 hours to figure out all the parts and assemble. Even though it comes with a simple manual for assembly, its more of a parts list that how-to instructions.</p><p>The main reason i choose Anet A8 -</p><ul><li>Cost Effective. I am studying in 3rd year Engineering, so I am not shelling even a single buck more than what is needed.</li><li> Modular. Since it comes in bits and pieces, almost everything can be replaced in case of failure or for maintenance.</li><li>Upgradable. Since its modular, it goes without saying, the components can be replaced with better ones.</li><li>Community support. A lot for forums, discussions and groups have grown around this printer. Getting the best configs for printer, slicer etc.. is easy.</li><li>OpenSource. All the details for the main controller are open source, including the firmware used (though I could not find it). Since it is based on Atmega 1284, which I am familiar with, I can make mods to code, or even flash better firmware like Marlin.</li></ul><p>Mods that I have made -</p><p>Right now I am pretty new, so I want to enjoy the printer in its bare-bones, before destroying it. that being said I have made some changes -</p><ul><li>Changed from painters tape based heater bed to glass panel. This gives a clean and smooth surface at the bottom of the print. Also sticks pretty good too, never had bed adhesion problems.</li><li>Filament spool holder changes. Added some 3D printed support structure so that the spool can turn smoothly. And also added some 3D printed filament guiders into the extruder.</li><li>Added OctoPrint. I have connected the printer to my Raspberry Pi running OctoPi OS, so that i can make it wireless and easy to operate with. Just make the Gcode file with your fav slicer and just drag-n-drop onto OctoPi. As simple as printing documents.</li></ul><p>Here's a funky timelapse of me assembling the printer - </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_wvDCPmVAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

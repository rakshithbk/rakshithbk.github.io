This goes with the rubber gaskets into the four arms. Important thing to keep in mind is the direction of frame - which is the front, and the CW - CCW motor placement. This is a X - config quad, so the basic rule of thumb is start with CCW at top right corner and continue alternating.</li><li>Next is to secure the main Flight Controller to the frame. Make sure the right direction is facing forward. This is indicated by a arrow on the PCB and this should be pointed to the front of the quad.</li><li>Solder all the motor leads to FC. I measured and cut wires to match the correct length so that they don&apos;t dangle or get caught in the spinning props. Wrap the wires few times around the arm. this way, in case you mess up the wire stripping or you want to move to different frame, you still have some extra wire to unwrap and use. </li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/motororder-quad-x-2d.png" width="573" height="758" loading="lazy" alt="Micro Coreless Quadcopter"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/IMG_20210501_193139.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Micro Coreless Quadcopter" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_193139.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/IMG_20210501_193139.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_193139.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2021/05/IMG_20210501_193139.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191049.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Micro Coreless Quadcopter" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191049.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191049.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191049.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191049.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191104.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Micro Coreless Quadcopter" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191104.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191104.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191104.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2021/05/IMG_20210501_191104.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><ul><li>One additional point I was not aware off, is that thee motors do have polarity. So for CW motor (Red &amp; Blue) - Red is positive and for CCW motor (Black &amp; White) - white is positive.<br>And on the FC, as you can see in the images above, each motor has two soldering pads. One of them has a passive component (should be a resistor) touching the pad and you should solder the negative terminal of motor to this pad on the board.</li><li>The four pad sets on the board are the UART ports.

Flutter uses a programming language called <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a>, which is similar to combination of C++ and JS. It is a Object oriented, garbage collected, strongly typed language that can compile to JS or Native code directly.</p><p>Since I did not know any mobile app development technologies, this got my attention as learning this would mean I can build apps for multi-platforms without having to learn multiple languages or frameworks. This chatting application is one of my first app that I made while trying to learn Dart and Flutter. Now that I look back on the code, few thing could have be written better &#x1F601;.</p><p>Rather than looking at tutorial videos where the main focus will be on explaining flutter and the UI will be awful, I chose to search for ideas on design/artist networking websites such as dribble and found a design that is simple to make yet elegant. <a href="https://search.muz.li/NDdkNDdkYmJj">This</a> is the final UI design idea I went ahead and implemented in this project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><video height="570" width="270" poster="../content/images/2021/05/mainScreenshot_o.png" autoplay loop muted>

In this project we are only using auth by username-password combinations. Firebase also supports other auth types such as social media (Google, Facebook, Twitter), phone, Apple, GitHub etc.. &#xA0;</p><p>Each user when they register will get a unique Auth ID in this section. This will be used thought out the application to identify the user and provide services to him. The Firebase console also neatly displays the registered users for the app along with UID, which will be helpful for debugging if needed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Basic Chat App - Flutter" loading="lazy" width="1358" height="554" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image.png 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/image.png 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image.png 1358w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Auth dashboard in Firebase console</figcaption></figure><p></p><p><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> - </p><p>Is the main runner of the show. It is a Realtime document database that we use for storing chats. When a user sends a new message, this database is updated and the other party listening to this particular document will also receive this update, without the need of polling.</p><p>In the project we use Firebase into two main documents - users and chats.<br>Users will maintain all registered users of the app, along with data such as Name, email, UID, Push notification ID, profile Image.<br>Chats will maintain the user chats with other users. Here the UID pair of the users between whom the conversation is happening is used as the key to store the messages. Hence chats between different users will have different UID pairs and will show as independent channels in the Firestore. </p><p>Along with the message content, other metadata such as sent time, From and To UID and message type is also saved. The type field is for extending this in the future to enable sending or GIFs or video links. In this case the type will be, for example 1 for GIF and 2-Video, and the content field will be treated as URL link to that media in such cases. This info can be used at the client side to provide rich display or render the media accordingly.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Basic Chat App - Flutter" loading="lazy" width="1358" height="503" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image-1.png 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/image-1.png 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image-1.png 1358w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>User document storing user meta in Firestore&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Basic Chat App - Flutter" loading="lazy" width="1343" height="487" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image-2.png 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/image-2.png 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2021/05/image-2.png 1343w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Chats document storing messages in Firestore</figcaption></figure><p></p><p><strong>Firebase Storage</strong> - </p><p>Is a simple object storage service that is only used for storing the user profile picture. It is simple as it comes integrated within Firebase ecosystem and has access to user auth ID. This ID will be used to make sure that one user will store atmost one image file in this bucket. Once the user updates this profile image, the older file will be overwritten with new one.

After the client sends the message to the user, through Firestore, the client will also send a push notification request to the recipient FCM ID. If the recipient does not have the app open, it will show a notification of new message and short text content.</p><p>Unlike other services, push notifications sent from the client will not show up in the Firebase console, so no image for this section &#x1F601;.</p><hr><h3 id="client-code-explanation">Client code explanation</h3><p></p><p>The main heart of the application is the Firebase SKDs or packages for each of its services in Dart.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-yaml">  firebase_core: ^1.0.1

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>These packages provide a simple and clean way to write your application logic by abstracting away all the API calls required to maintain connection and tokens to use the services. They also support Streams in Dart which is a great way to subscribe to the service and get updates in realtime when something changes. </p><p>For example in the below snippet you can see the Auth implementation, where if the <code>firebase_auth</code> package will maintain the session info and will automatically update in case of session expiry so that the app can show login screen again.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/c7b1f306e360d3029ee19a374343d2a4.js"></script>

But I wanted to try out local storage/persistance as well. Here I am using a package called <code>hive</code>. This a simple and fast key-value database. The reason this was chosen was that the data structure to be stored is not complex and the performance of hive is better that SQL.<br>In this project I am only storing contact list along with meta information like last message, timestamp, UID etc..<br>So in the totality your device will contain contact list of the chat app, data related to Firebase tokens and auth, cached images that were downloaded.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/5f1958eddaf672f37350a56f806df628.js"></script>

So the depth of the shelf space is very less and all of it has to be made use of to get a good tank. Measurements were taken for this with very less tolerances and thankfully it fit perfectly in the shelf.</p><p>A 5mm glass was used for this tank, again keeping the space constraints in mind 10mm would take up space unnecessarily and 3mm was too thin for my to feel safe. The glass was cut into required pieces and edges were sanded to make handling easy. All the pieces were put together with clear silicon gel. But before that masking tape was stuck along the edges leaving a centimetre gap. This will take all the mess while applying silicon and leave a clean finish on the glass.</p><p>The front will have only glass upto 1/3 length and other three sides will have glass to full length to prevent splashes and drops to spill outside. A 1/2&quot; hole was drilled to one of the side panels. This will be used for drain tubing into the bottom tank. </p><p>This tank will hold approx 4L of water. The dimensions for my setup is - <br>320 x 130 mm -&gt; front<br>340 x 130 mm -&gt; 2x sides<br>340 x 320 mm -&gt; back<br>320 x 140 mm -&gt; bottom</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200626_153857.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_153857.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/IMG_20200626_153857.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_153857.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/IMG_20200626_153857.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200626_160529.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_160529.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/IMG_20200626_160529.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_160529.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/IMG_20200626_160529.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170556.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170556.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170556.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170556.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170556.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170545.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170545.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170545.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170545.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/IMG_20200626_170545.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200627_185046.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Final tank after silicon has dried</figcaption></figure><h3></h3><hr><h3 id="3d-design-and-printing-parts">3D design and printing parts</h3><p></p><p>The first part that was required was the container in the main tank, where plants would go.

So re-printed another in white pla with a flat corner.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="18345006" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.7722419928825621"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200704_182752.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Waterfall Paludarium" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Getting a rough sketch of the water flow and pot placement.</figcaption></figure><p>The second thing that needed printing is the filter attachment to the water pump.

Selecting plants</h3><p></p><p>The place the plant are going to be in will be compact and not much sunlight and wind reach for sufficient time of the day. Should mostly relay on artificial lights. And in terms of water, even though they will be frequently watered, the tub is not deep enough to retain much water and hence the plants should be a bit on the tough and resilient side.</p><p>Since I am going for a forest look, a plant with smaller leaves will add to the miniature and dense look of the scene. The plants I found in my local nursery that met my criteria are fern and asparagus fern.</p><p>Initially I wanted to go for a old civilization ruins look, something like Mayan or rock heads of Easter island. But these are a bit delicate in terms and plants needed and takes some time for collecting the tiny artifacts. And you would have already seen in the images, I found a good looking Buddha statue and made it the center piece of my setup. The Lost World of Knowledge and Nirvana.</p><p>No Buddha setup is complete without bamboo. So also added a bunch of lucky/bonsai bamboo (its not actually bamboo, it is from Dracaena family).</p><p>Topped all the visible soil with live moss from garden. The green moss with tiny plants in it will add the miniature forest flora look I was going for. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102104.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Lost World Terrarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102104.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102104.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102104.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102104.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200718_121434.jpg" width="2000" height="944" loading="lazy" alt="Lost World Terrarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20200718_121434.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20200718_121434.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20200718_121434.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20200718_121434.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102035.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Lost World Terrarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102035.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102035.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102035.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102035.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102048.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Lost World Terrarium" srcset="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102048.jpg 600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102048.jpg 1000w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102048.jpg 1600w, https://rbklabs.in/content/images/size/w2400/2020/08/IMG_20200809_102048.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p></p><hr><h3 id="3-putting-it-all-together">3.

The main components use are -</p><ul><li>WS2812B</li><li>ESP32</li><li>Power Supply</li></ul><p>The reason this is so simple is thanks to the individually addressable LEDs WS2812b. Without these, an Edge of the shelf or a segment in the 7-seg display of the digit had to be wired to the controller separately. And since most of the controllers will not have these many I/O pins, something like multiplexing or shift register should be used. This would have greatly increased the wiring and circuitry.</p><p>WS2812b is well tested and has good libraries written to abstract dealing with the data signals and controlling these ICs. In this project we will be using <a href="http://fastled.io/">FastLED</a>.</p><p>ESP32 is again my favorite low power low cost microcontroller with inbuilt WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. </p><p>Step 1 - Cutting the strip into smaller pieces<br>I could not stick the LEDs in single long strip as this would result in LEDs being present inbetween digit segments. So I measured the number of LEDs that would fit in each of the printed edge and cut the strip into pieces. 7 LEDs per segment in my case (with 60/m strip density).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/IMG_20200802_163115.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Digital Shelf Clock" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Cutting strip for each Segment of the digit</figcaption></figure><p>Step 2 - Soldering the cut strips<br>The strips for each segment are soldered with small pieces of wire of length equal to the distance between two segments on the shelf.

I have borrowed his code and modified it to work with my wiring schematic and my OTA update library.</p><p>In a very brief explanation, this is what the program does.<br>The controller is connected to the internet (via wifi). Since there is no RTC or timekeeping systems on board, everytime the board is started, it will ping <a href="https://www.ntppool.org/en/">NTP </a> and fetch the correct time. Internal clocks on ESP can be used to update the time from this starting point, but periodically ESP will fetch time from the NTP servers to account for any drifts in the time (due to inaccuracies in internal clock). &#xA0;Next is taking care of display and setting the LEDs according to the time.<br>Since the LEDs used are RGB, any color can be set to the digits. And the ESP works with blynk to provide this capability, so that the user can change colors and adjust brightness anytime from smartphone.<br>I plan on adding other functionalities like integrating google assistant to show time by asking country wise, add a snake game and more.</p><hr><h3 id="testing-connections-and-first-run">Testing connections and first run</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/08/led_first_test_optimized.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Digital Shelf Clock" loading="lazy"></figure><p></p><h3 id="done">Done</h3><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="18050147" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.7785714285714287"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p style="text-align: center;">**** &#x907;&#x924;&#x93F; &#x932;&#x947;&#x916;&#x903; &#x938;&#x92E;&#x93E;&#x92A;&#x94D;&#x924;&#x92E;&#x94D; ****</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snails in a Jar]]></title><description><![CDATA[From a Stick to Snails to Eggs to Baby Snail...]]></description><link>https://rbklabs.in/snails-in-a-jar/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f1db7b2bfea5f1170e6e1b5</guid><category><![CDATA[Nature]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rakshith BK]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 17:30:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/IMG_20200619_113857.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/IMG_20200619_113857.jpg" alt="Snails in a Jar"><p>It all started with a stick.

This is the barebone structure of the process - </p><ol><li>Check in code in frequently.</li><li>Automate the build and test portion.</li><li>Always test the code locally before checking it in.</li><li>Never merge any failed branches to the main branch.</li><li>Return its status back to successful if you&#x2019;re the developer who causes the failed build or test.</li><li>Make it your top priority to do so once the fail happens.</li></ol><p><strong>CD or Continuous Delivery/Deployment </strong>-</p><p>CD is more of continuation to CI. Generally the will be lot of work involved in order to deploy new application. Stop running processes, swap binaries, restart services in the required order and this is time consuming. The same applies even if its a on premise application, might be little simple, but still present. Create the right package - only the changes or the complete binaries, deploy on the CDS, notify user/application and handle the load.</p><p>So it is suitable to automate this process and in most of the time it remains constant through out the lifecycle of the application. CD can usually have different kinds of triggers, run a CD on commit, run a CD at specific time interval or have a manual trigger. </p><hr><h3 id="pipeline-in-hardware-projects">Pipeline in Hardware projects ?</h3><p></p><p>A CI/CD pipeline is almost always present in software based organizations. Without one its almost impossible to maintain quality and standard in the development and sanity of the master branch. All code goes through unit tests and the commits are run against automated test scripts or tested in sandbox envs.</p><p>But what about personal projects ? Especially Hardware projects ? when compared to software applications, in addition to all the steps involved, there is one more step of flashing to the board. So all the more reason to have a automated pipeline for this. </p><hr><h3 id="setup-your-own-pipeline-">Setup your own pipeline -</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543674892-7d64d45df18b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" class="kg-image" alt="CI / CD pipeline for ESP32" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@realaxer?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">tian kuan</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There are two parts to this process, the client side or ESP code for checking for updates, and the backend side for CI/CD pipeline. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>ESP32 / hardware side -</strong></p><p>Lets look at the ESP side, the board can either poll the server time to time, or if there is a persistent connection, the server can inform when there is an update available. As an IoT endpoint, such devices will generally not have a public IP or if it is low power based, connection cannot be kept alive. </p><p>But if there is a requirement for the update to delivered as soon as its available, MQTT can be used for so that server can notify, and its designed for low power consumption.</p><p>In my case, the update cycle is more relaxed. ESP periodically checks with backend if there are any updates, so there will be couple of minutes of delay before the ESP checks and downloads the update. This depends on the checking interval defined.</p><p>Going into more specifics, the ESP will ask the backend for the latest version of the ESP firmware. After we get the response, the version is checked against its own firmware. If the version on backend is greater, then the new firmware is downloaded. There is a MD5 check for the binary downloaded to make sure that it is the right file (no man-in-middle attack &#x1F605;) and there are not corruptions at downloading. &#xA0;After the check is passed the new update is applied.</p><p>Its good to note that even if faulty binary is flashed as part of the OTA, the ESP will never be rendered dead. On the soft reset after the update, if the ESP is not able to boot, it will roll back to the previous version. This is possible because the update will be flashed to new partition and moving back to old firmware is as simple as changing partition address in the lookup table. A great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" >video</a> on this if you are interested.</p><p>Right now the OTA library for ESP32 is in my &#xA0;private repo, still needs some testing. I will add it here as soon as possible or checkout by GitHub repos.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/07/ota_esp_cropped.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="CI / CD pipeline for ESP32" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Flow between ESP32 and the backend.

This is achievable if the motion of the finger across the surface is somehow translated into change in capacitance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/download.gif" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Slider Control in Action.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="principle-of-operation">Principle of operation</h3><p>The capacitive slider surface can be of any shape and size you want. In this project I am simply using a strip of aluminium foil.</p><p>The main principle this works on is -</p><blockquote>Capacitance changes with increase/decrease in thickness of dielectric between the two electrodes.</blockquote><p>To leverage this I am creating a gradient of insulator on top of the aluminium foil to get this change in the capacitance from one end of the strip to another.</p><p>The choice of dielectric is clear plastic tape (sellotape), that is applied multiple layers. The tape is cut shorter by a few mm each time for the new layer applied on the aluminium foil. This will create a gradual increase in the thickness of the insulation over the strip. The change is still in terms of discreet steps, resolution of which should be decided based on the application and use case.</p><p>I could not take any good pictures to show the layering on my strip, so here&apos;s a 3D render of what it will look like -</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/mtal_strip.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Each translucent square is one sensitivity zone, so this strip has a resolution of 6.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/06/dielectric_gradient.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="ESP32 Touch Slider-controller" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The layers of tape gets shorter as visible, to change the dielectric thickness</figcaption></figure><hr><h3 id="code">Code</h3><p>The logic is to read the touch inputs repeatedly and check if the value has increased or decrease as compared to the previous reading. Each time such increase or decrease happens ideally your finger has moved from a point on the strip of one thickness to another point of different thickness.</p><p><strong><strong>By having a count of such increase/decrease, we can get an analog value reading as well as direction of swipe.</strong></strong> And this can be achieved from one GPIO pin of ESP32.</p><p>Note: The code provided in this project is more of an proof of concept than a finished library. A lot has to be refined and polished before turning this into a general purpose library that can be used along with others in a typical project.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/f69d29d2b7344cf97f98c91c262c1e66.js"></script>

In the example I will be decoding the captch of VTU website, which is an University for Engineering courses and has captcha at results portal. <br>The approach detailed in this article is not a general purpose solution, but can be used for captchas of similar complexities.<br>This is NOT a ML based solution.</blockquote><p> </p><h3 id="preface">Preface</h3><p>VTU results page is known for its speed, reliability, performance and user-friendly interface. Or rather the lack of it. Every semester, even though the org knows exactly how many students will be looking forward for their results, it always fails to scale up their servers to cater to this load. It usually takes hours to get your results after they are released. The webpage does not load, the result request is not queried, or the whole website just crashes. And moreover the results of the previous semester will be wiped out before the new ones are uploaded. So there is no way for a student to get his last results (screenshot is the only option) or rather all his sem results in one place.</p><p>I wanted to create a website that would store these results, of all semesters and would display them on request. And this also falls under the web-scraping domain, which I wanted to do a project in. So I started to work on getting the details required, but the problem was the form to query the results also had a CAPTCHA.</p><p>So in this article i will be explaining the steps I took to decode them and convert to text so that I can get whats behind it.</p><hr><h3 id="the-captcha-image">The CAPTCHA image</h3><p>The image is not that complex when compared to other google captchas that has a lot of features like warping, tilt, blur, skew etc.. to consider in the text that has to be decoded.</p><p>Saying that, this took a bit of work as well, since I decided to solve this without additional libraries, just simple python. Using open source projects Tessaract or other OCRs will be a bit of overkill for this Image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/yourcaptcha.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA" loading="lazy"><figcaption>captcha image in the results page of the website.</figcaption></figure><p>I saved a few such Images and found that the text is always at the center and in green color. And the entire image is covered in static/noise. </p><p>Initially I thought of extracting Green from the RGB matrix of the image, since the text that i want is entirely in green. But this didn&apos;t work as there was a lot of noise pixels that were in green also. What worked is a simple thresholding of the image.<br>Converted my image to monochrome/binary with appropriate threshold value to select between black pixel or white pixel worked far better than I had imagined.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/ff9eb3ab97f534be6acf5922de09323d.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Output of this thresholding captcha -</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/yourcaptcha-2.jpeg" width="176" height="35" loading="lazy" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/captcha_Thresh-1.jpeg" width="176" height="35" loading="lazy" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA"></div></div></div></figure><p>Now that the text is clear, next is the OCR part of actually converting the contents on the image to usable text. Before that I had saved bunch of images and there was a pattern emerging, all the characters occupied same space at the middle of the image. And to visualize it better, I used this <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image">web-tool</a> to convert the pixels to text characters and saved it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/vtu_captcha_word_doc.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Approach to decoding CAPTCHA" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Each character in that text is a pixel in binary.</figcaption></figure><p>Some points that came out about this captcha now-</p><ol><li>The text is always at the center and starts at <code>[60,11]</code> ie. top left corner and ends at <code>[113, 23]</code> ie. bottom right corner.</li><li>Each character in the text occupies exactly the same number of pixels ie- same height and width. Which means a rectangle mask can be used to extract each individual char. The dimensions of this mask <code>8 X 12</code>.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="manual-labeling">Manual Labeling </h3><p>Now that we know the dimensions and position of the charterers in the image and we have removed the noise, the next step is to isolate each character and start labeling. This is one step that is not automated, but is also one-time requirement.</p><p>Using a small script, I downloaded a bunch of captchas and chopped them down to individual characters and saved each one with different number as file name.<br>During the process I found out that characters - &#xA0; <code>I L O i l o 1 0</code> &#xA0;are not used. Which is actually quite obvious when you think about it, they are hard to distinguish from each other in several fonts.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/rakshithbk/1a54149e185e9ef47d71950261859f26.js"></script>

T-shirt Printing</h3><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---dark-1.jpg" alt="3D print - Experimental Stuff"><p>3D printing is essentially chopping down objects into thin 2D surfaces and printing them on top of each other. So why don&apos;t we just stop the print after 2-3 layers to get a regular print on a surface ? And instead of on printbed, why not print on fabric ?</p><p>So I clamped an old t-shirt on to the print bed, removed the glass panel, and adjusted the end/stop switch for the z-axis to account for this change in height. Then i made a gcode for a 2mm thickness print and tried it out.</p><p>Things to keep in mind -</p><ul><li>Make sure the nozzle height is adjusted properly. If not this could drag the cloth with the nozzle moment, burning it or damaging the nozzle itself.</li><li>Keep the extruder temperature to a minimum. Make sure the temp is only what is required, this is because prints on white cloths left a dark shade at parts with thin print lines. That being said don&apos;t lower the temp so low that the extruder jams. Usually PLA has a range to temp that it can be used with, keep it at the lower end.</li><li>Have a good end script on your slicer. I have used a script that will lift the extruder 20mm and then home all axis. This will keep the rest of your t shirt that&apos;s dangling outside of the printbed safe.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://rbklabs.in/content/images/2020/05/IMG_20190127_130119---Copy.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="3D print - Experimental Stuff" loading="lazy"><figcaption>This is 1 layer thick print.

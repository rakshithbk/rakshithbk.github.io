Since it comes in bits and pieces, almost everything can be replaced in case of failure or for maintenance.</li><li>Upgradable. Since its modular, it goes without saying, the components can be replaced with better ones.</li><li>Community support. A lot for forums, discussions and groups have grown around this printer. Getting the best configs for printer, slicer etc.. is easy.</li><li>OpenSource. All the details for the main controller are open source, including the firmware used (though I could not find it). Since it is based on Atmega 1284, which I am familiar with, I can make mods to code, or even flash better firmware like Marlin.</li></ul><p>Mods that I have made -</p><p>Right now I am pretty new, so I want to enjoy the printer in its bare-bones, before destroying it. that being said I have made some changes -</p><ul><li>Changed from painters tape based heater bed to glass panel. This gives a clean and smooth surface at the bottom of the print. Also sticks pretty good too, never had bed adhesion problems.</li><li>Filament spool holder changes. Added some 3D printed support structure so that the spool can turn smoothly. And also added some 3D printed filament guiders into the extruder.</li><li>Added OctoPrint. I have connected the printer to my Raspberry Pi running OctoPi OS, so that i can make it wireless and easy to operate with. Just make the Gcode file with your fav slicer and just drag-n-drop onto OctoPi. As simple as printing documents.</li></ul><p>Here's a funky timelapse of me assembling the printer - </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_wvDCPmVAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
